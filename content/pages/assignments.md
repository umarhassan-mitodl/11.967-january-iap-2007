Each student needs to complete an economic profile and proposed economic development agenda for Hartford, Vermont. Two assignments address analytical steps to help prepare the final report. The first assignment concerns working with basic secondary data to develop an understanding of an area's economic performance and structure and will be discussed on the second class. A second assignment covers the use of secondary data for retail market analysis and will be discussed in the fourth class. These assignments are intended to apply tools discussed in class and complete work that leads to the final economic analysis and recommended agenda. Background information on this community and demographic and economic employment data for Hartford, Windsor County and Grafton County are provided. The goal of the profile is to use relevant techniques studied in class to analyze Hartford's local economy and present finding and their implications for the community's economic agenda.
